## Features in Detail

### Password Protection
- Your password is stored securely in browser localStorage (base64 encoded)
- First-time users set up a password, returning users must log in
- No data is sent to any server - everything stays on your device
- **Important**: Remember your password! If forgotten, you'll need to reset (see below)

### Smart Filtering
- Search across company names, roles, and locations
- Filter by job category (Software Engineering, Data Science, etc.)
- Filter by application status (Applied/Not Applied)

### Data Persistence
Your application status is saved locally in your browser, so you won't lose track of your progress even if you close the tab.

### Export Functionality
Export your applied jobs list as a JSON file for backup or integration with other tools.

## Security & Privacy

All data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage:
- Your password (base64 encoded)
- Your application tracking data
- No data is ever sent to external servers (except fetching job listings from GitHub)

### Reset Password

If you forget your password, open your browser's console and run:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('job-tracker-password');
localStorage.removeItem('job-tracker-authenticated');
```
Then refresh the page to set a new password. **Note**: This will keep your application data intact.
