# Migration to Backend Database

## What Changed?

Your job tracker has been **upgraded from localStorage to a proper backend database** with user authentication!

### Before (localStorage):
- ‚ùå Data lost on browser cache clear
- ‚ùå Not synced across devices
- ‚ùå No multi-user support
- ‚ùå Limited to one browser

### After (Supabase Backend):
- ‚úÖ Data persists in PostgreSQL database
- ‚úÖ Sync across all your devices
- ‚úÖ Each user has their own account
- ‚úÖ Secure email + password authentication
- ‚úÖ Automatic backups
- ‚úÖ No data loss

## What You Need To Do

### 1. Set Up Supabase (5 minutes)

1. **Create Account**: Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up (free!)
2. **Create Project**: Click "New Project" and give it a name
3. **Run SQL Migration**: 
   - Go to SQL Editor in Supabase
   - Copy all code from `lib/database.sql`
   - Paste and click "Run"
4. **Get API Keys**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API
   - Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` in the `job-tracker` folder:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

Replace with your actual values from step 1!

### 3. Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Create Your Account

- Click "Sign Up"
- Enter your email and password
- Start tracking jobs!

## Database Schema

### `applied_jobs` table

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | bigint | Auto-incrementing primary key |
| user_id | uuid | References auth.users (who owns this record) |
| job_id | text | Unique job identifier |
| company | text | Company name |
| role | text | Job title |
| location | text | Job location |
| category | text | Job category |
| age | text | How old the listing is |
| application_url | text | Link to apply (optional) |
| notes | text | User notes (optional, for future use) |
| applied_at | timestamp | When job was marked as applied |

**Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own data.

## Breaking Changes

### Old Auth System (localStorage)
```typescript
// Old way - localStorage password
const isAuth = isAuthenticated();  // Checked localStorage
login(password);  // Just a password
```

### New Auth System (Supabase)
```typescript
// New way - Email + Password
const user = await getCurrentUser();  // Gets actual user from Supabase
await signIn(email, password);  // Email + password required
```

### Old Storage System
```typescript
// Old way - localStorage
const applied = loadAppliedJobs();  // From localStorage
toggleJobApplied(jobId);  // Saves to localStorage
```

### New Storage System
```typescript
// New way - Database
const applied = await getAppliedJobs();  // From database
await toggleJobApplication(job, isApplied);  // Saves to database
```

## Features You Can Add Later

The new backend enables many future enhancements:

- üìù **Notes**: Add notes to each application
- üìÖ **Deadlines**: Set application deadlines
- üìä **Analytics**: Track application success rates
- üîî **Notifications**: Email reminders for deadlines
- üë• **Sharing**: Share your list with friends
- üì± **Mobile App**: Build a native mobile version

All of these are now possible because your data is in a real database!

## Troubleshooting

### "Supabase environment variables not set"
‚Üí Make sure `.env.local` exists with correct values  
‚Üí Restart your dev server after creating the file

### "Failed to sign in"
‚Üí Check that you ran the SQL migration in Supabase  
‚Üí Make sure your password is at least 6 characters

### Email confirmation required
‚Üí Go to Supabase: Authentication ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Email  
‚Üí Turn off "Confirm email" for development

## Migration from Old Data

Unfortunately, **localStorage data cannot be automatically migrated** because:
1. Old system had no user accounts (just one password for everyone)
2. New system requires individual user accounts
3. Data was stored client-side only

**If you had important data:**
1. Use the old version to export your data (Download button)
2. Keep the JSON file for reference
3. In the new version, manually re-mark jobs as applied

Sorry for the inconvenience! The new system is much more reliable.
