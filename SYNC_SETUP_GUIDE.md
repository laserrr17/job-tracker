# Sync Jobs Setup Guide

## Problem
When you click the "Sync" button, the jobs table remains empty because the sync operation requires the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable.

## Why is this needed?
The `jobs` table has Row Level Security (RLS) enabled. Only users with the `service_role` permission can insert or update jobs. This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Solution

### Step 1: Get your Service Role Key from Supabase

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
4. Scroll down to **Project API keys**
5. Find the **`service_role`** key (it's different from the `anon` key)
6. Click the eye icon to reveal it
7. Copy the key

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: The service role key bypasses all Row Level Security. Keep it secret and never expose it in client-side code!

### Step 2: Add the Service Role Key to your environment

#### For Local Development:

1. Open (or create) the file `.env.local` in the `job-tracker` folder
2. Add this line (replace with your actual key):

```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-actual-service-role-key-here
```

Your `.env.local` should now look like this:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

3. **Restart your development server**:
   - Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run `npm run dev` again

#### For Production (Vercel):

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Click **Add New**
4. Enter:
   - **Name**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - **Value**: (paste your service role key)
   - **Environments**: Check all (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Click **Save**
6. **Redeploy** your application for the changes to take effect

### Step 3: Test the Sync

1. Refresh your browser (to clear any cache)
2. Log in to your app
3. Click the **"Sync Jobs"** button (üîÑ icon)
4. You should see a success message: "Successfully synced [number] jobs from GitHub!"
5. The jobs should now appear in your table

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is required"
- **Cause**: The environment variable is not set
- **Fix**: Follow Step 2 above and make sure to restart your dev server

### Error: "Permission denied"
- **Cause**: Using wrong key or RLS policy issue
- **Fix**: 
  1. Double-check you copied the **service_role** key (not the anon key)
  2. Verify the database schema was set up correctly by running the SQL in `lib/database.sql`

### Sync succeeds but jobs still don't show
- **Cause**: README parsing might have failed or returned 0 jobs
- **Check**: 
  1. Open browser console (F12) and look for error messages
  2. Check the Network tab for the POST request to `/api/jobs`
  3. The response should show the count of jobs synced

### Jobs show but can't mark as applied
- **Cause**: Different issue - user authentication or RLS for applied_jobs table
- **Fix**: Make sure you're logged in and the `applied_jobs` table exists with correct RLS policies

## What Changed?

I've improved the error handling so you'll get clear error messages if:
- The service role key is missing
- There's a permission issue
- The sync operation fails for any reason

The error messages will now guide you to the solution instead of failing silently.

## Next Steps

After syncing successfully:
1. ‚úÖ You should see all jobs from the GitHub README
2. ‚úÖ You can filter by category, location, etc.
3. ‚úÖ You can mark jobs as applied
4. ‚úÖ Your data persists across sessions
5. ‚úÖ Re-syncing will update the job list with new postings
