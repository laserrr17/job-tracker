## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Migration

**Old localStorage data cannot be automatically migrated** because:
- Old system had no user accounts
- New system requires individual user accounts
- Data was stored client-side only

**If you had data before:**
1. Export your data using the Download button (old version)
2. Keep the JSON for reference
3. Manually re-mark jobs in the new version

Sorry for the inconvenience - the new system is much better!

### Email Confirmation (Optional)

By default, Supabase requires email confirmation. To disable for development:
1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email
2. Turn off "Confirm email"
3. Save changes

---

## 🎉 That's It!

You now have:
- ✅ Real user accounts
- ✅ Persistent database storage
- ✅ Application date tracking
- ✅ Cross-device sync
- ✅ Never lose data again!

**Happy job hunting!** 🚀
